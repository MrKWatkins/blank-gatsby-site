# blank-gatsby-site

A blank Gatsby site to use as a template when creating a new site. Comes preconfigured to be written in TypeScript and SASS with support for Markdown and BlueprintJS and testing with Jest and Enzyme.

Feel free to use as a starting point for your own projects, just be aware I offer no support whatsoever! For similar reasons I have no plans to turn it into a Gatsby starter.
